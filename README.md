## 🎯 Objective

To address low engagement and generalization in digital learning platforms by clustering students based on their preferred learning styles and tailoring content accordingly for improved learning outcomes.

---

## 📖 Background

The shift to digital education has exposed limitations in one-size-fits-all instructional design. By applying the **VARK (Visual, Auditory, Read/Write, Kinesthetic)** learning model and clustering techniques, this research demonstrates a personalized approach to content delivery and interaction.

## 🛠️ Methods & Tools

- **Model**: VARK Questionnaire  
- **Algorithm**: K-Means Clustering  
- **Tools**: Python (scikit-learn, pandas, matplotlib)

### 📊 Dataset

- **Source**: Primary data from 30 student respondents (SD–SMA) in Jakarta  
- **Input**: VARK questionnaire responses  
- **Output**: Clustered learning style profiles  

---

## 🔍 Clustering Process

1. **Data Collection** via VARK-based survey  
2. **Preprocessing**: Encoding learning style scores  
3. **Optimal Clusters**: Determined via **Elbow Method**  
4. **Validation**: Silhouette Score = **0.43**  
5. **Output**: 2 major student clusters based on style similarity

---

## 💡 Key Findings

- Students grouped into 2 optimal clusters with distinct learning style preferences  
- The system enables **personalized material recommendation** and **peer group formation**  
- Demonstrated potential to **increase student engagement and comprehension** in online learning environments
